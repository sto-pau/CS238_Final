"""
    optimize(f, g, x0, n, prob)

Arguments:
    - `f`: Function to be optimized
    - `g`: Gradient function for `f`
    - `x0`: (Vector) Initial position to start from
    - `n`: (Int) Number of evaluations allowed. Remember `g` costs twice of `f`
    - `prob`: (String) Name of the problem. So you can use a different strategy for each problem. E.g. "simple1", "secret2", etc.

Returns:
    - The location of the minimum
